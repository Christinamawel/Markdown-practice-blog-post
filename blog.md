##My small Family
my family at home right now consists of my boyfirend and my two little kittys. My boyfirends name is Andrew and I met him through playing a video game called Splatoon and the nintendo wii u. he moved here to Washington from Wisconsin a little over a year ago now and I am so lucky to have him.

We have two little boy kittys named Jinkins and Cheeto. Jinkins is a tuxedo cat who is a little over a year old, and Cheeto is a fluffy orange cat who is about 9 months. they are little balls of energy but they are fun.
